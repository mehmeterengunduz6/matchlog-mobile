# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Backend setup (Matchlog)

The mobile app talks to the Matchlog Next.js backend.

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` (optional): Override the API base URL. For local dev on device, set this to your machine IP, e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:3000/api`.
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_EXPO_CLIENT_ID`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`: Google OAuth client IDs for Expo Auth Session.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
